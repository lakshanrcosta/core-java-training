# Java Platform Independence - Study Notes

## 1. Definition
- Java is a **platform-independent** language, meaning that compiled Java code can run on any system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

## 2. How It Works
- Java source code (`.java`) is compiled into **bytecode** (`.class`) by the Java compiler.
- The bytecode is executed by the **JVM**, which is available for various operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.).
- The JVM translates bytecode into machine-specific instructions at runtime.

## 3. Key Features Enabling Platform Independence
- **Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)**: Java applications do not need to be recompiled for different platforms.
- **Bytecode Interpretation**: JVM interprets bytecode and executes it on different operating systems.
- **JVM Abstraction**: The JVM acts as an abstraction layer, making the underlying OS differences irrelevant to Java programs.

## 4. Comparison with Other Languages
| Language | Compilation | Platform Independence |
|----------|------------|----------------------|
| **C/C++** | Requires platform-specific compilation | ❌ No |
| **Java** | Uses a single compiled bytecode for all platforms | ✅ Yes |

## 5. Limitations
- JVM must be installed on the target system.
- Performance may be slightly lower compared to natively compiled languages like C/C++.

## 6. Conclusion
- Java’s platform independence makes it ideal for **cross-platform development**, web applications, mobile apps (Android), and enterprise solutions.
