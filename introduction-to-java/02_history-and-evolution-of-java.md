# 📜 History and Evolution of Java

## 🏛 Introduction
Java is a **high-level, object-oriented programming language** developed by **Sun Microsystems** in **1995**. It was designed to be **platform-independent** and follows the principle of **"Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA)**. Over the years, Java has evolved with multiple versions, adding new features and improvements.

## 📅 Timeline of Java Evolution

### 🔹 1991: The Birth of Java
- Java was originally conceived by **James Gosling**, **Mike Sheridan**, and **Patrick Naughton** at Sun Microsystems.
- The project was initially called **"Oak"** (named after an oak tree outside Gosling’s office).
- It was developed for embedded systems and home appliances.

### 🔹 1995: Java 1.0 – Official Release
- Sun Microsystems officially released Java as **Java 1.0**.
- It was renamed from **Oak** to **Java** due to trademark issues.
- Key Features:
  - Platform Independence via **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**
  - Automatic Memory Management (Garbage Collection)
  - Applet support for web browsers

### 🔹 1997: Java 1.1 – Improved APIs
- Event Delegation Model introduced.
- Inner Classes and JavaBeans introduced.

### 🔹 1998: Java 2 (J2SE 1.2)
- Java was rebranded as **Java 2** (J2SE).
- Introduction of **Swing** for GUI development.
- Java Collections Framework (JCF) introduced.

### 🔹 2000: Java 2 (J2SE 1.3 & 1.4)
- Performance improvements.
- **Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI)** and **Regular Expressions** added.

### 🔹 2004: Java 5 (J2SE 5.0)
- Renamed to **Java SE**.
- Major enhancements:
  - **Generics**

### 🔹 2011: Java 7 (SE 7) – Project Coin
- Introduced:
  - **Try-with-resources** (Automatic resource management)
  - **Diamond operator (`<>`)**
  - **NIO 2.0 for better file handling**

### 🔹 2014: Java 8 – The Most Revolutionary Update
- Introduced:
  - **Lambda Expressions** → Functional-style programming.
  - **Streams API** → Simplifies data processing.
  - **Default Methods** in interfaces.
  - **New Date & Time API (java.time)**.
  - **Optional Class**.

### 🔹 2017: Java 9 – Modularization (Project Jigsaw)
- **Java Platform Module System (JPMS)** introduced.
- **JShell (REPL for Java)**.
- **Improved Streams API**.

### 🔹 2018: Java 10 & 11 – LTS (Long-Term Support)
- Java 10:
  - **`var` keyword** for local variable type inference.
- Java 11 (LTS):
  - **HTTP Client API**.
  - **String API Enhancements**.
  - **Garbage Collector (ZGC, Epsilon)**.

### 🔹 2019 - 2021: Java 12 to 17 (LTS)
